    "\n",
    "When working with a new dataset, one of the most useful things to do is to begin to visualize the data. By using **tables**, **histograms**, **boxplots**, **scatter plots** and other visual tools, we can get a better idea of what the data may be trying to tell us, and we can gain insights into the data that we may have not discovered otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook will use the [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) data processing library, which is a higher-level interface to **Matplotlib** that can be used to simplify many visualization tasks \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Seaborn** provides visualisations tools that will allow to explore data from a graphical perspective. \n",
